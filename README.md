## **About Me**
As a third-year computer science major and a mathematical science minor, I am passionate about making and growing from mistakes; "We learn to walk by falling down. If we never fell down, we would never walk." — Robert T. Kiyosaki. Coding and math are no exception; all the trial and error with each instance of creating a new project or step to solve a problem are like a breeding ground for all the possible ways things could go wrong. Although making mistakes can be very frustrating, each is a new lesson learned and gained experience. I've made many mistakes since the beginning of my programming and math journey, and it's not only about making mistakes but what you do afterward. I take my mistakes very seriously and truly understand why something went wrong to understand how never to make that mistake again. Through making these mistakes and taking the time to understand what I did wrong, I have learned more about how I should program or approach problems than if I had never made any mistakes, an invaluable skill that one must learn the hard way. I take these skills to all aspects of my life, and I am passionate about the growth that comes with failure.
